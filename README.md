# Cells and Neural Nets Experiments

This library is intended for use as something of a playground for experimenting with neural network-like data structures in DART.

I've intentionally coded it using Visual Studio Code to expose myself to working in environments other than the Jetbrains IDEs.

# Things Learned from This Project

## How do I run all my tests from the Command Line?

You can use the [pub command](https://pub.dev/packages/test#running-tests)

as in:

```
pub run test test
```
